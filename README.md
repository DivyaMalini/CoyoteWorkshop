
This repository contains exercises for a workshop designed to teach the [Coyote](https://github.com/Microsoft/coyote) framework. It consists of two exercises which build upon each other.

Each exercise contains a battery of Coyote tests, along with mocks for a database and cloud storage service and the workshop attendees are tasked to implement the methods of two controllers using the mocks such that there code passes the Coyote tests.
